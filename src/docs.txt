ForwardRef:            basically we use this to remove the error we are getting while the circular dependecy is created

circular dependency:   so the ciscular dependecy is for example we ahve user and post module and we use user service in post module and post service in 
                           user module so the cicular dependecy is created to avaoid that we use this forward ref

Type Orm:               So basically the type orm is one of the orm we ahve many other orm like prisma, mongoose, serilize and many more 
                        so basically orm is that supooser we want to create any user so instaed of writing sql command for that we use orm so basically its provide method which
                         we can use and we dont care how the sql will be managed we juts use that methods and method aare like create , find one , find and many more 

                         the entity we created in that we use one to one, one to mahy are also part of orm
entity                  while creatig entity we ahve make  anamimg convention singular like user not users post not posts
                        enitty is the file that contain the column of the database

Extends keyword         Suppose we have dto in that we have multiple property and we want to create a new dto but it also contain the same value that the other dto conatin but in this we want them to be optional
                        so for that we can use extends it extend the property from the fisrt dto and mak ethem all optional
