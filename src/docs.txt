ForwardRef:     ======       basically we use this to remove the error we are getting while the circular dependecy is created

circular dependency:  =======  so the ciscular dependecy is for example we ahve user and post module and we use user service in post module and post service in 
                           user module so the cicular dependecy is created to avaoid that we use this forward ref

Type Orm:     =======          So basically the type orm is one of the orm we ahve many other orm like prisma, mongoose, serilize and many more 
                        so basically orm is that supooser we want to create any user so instaed of writing sql command for that we use orm so basically its provide method which
                         we can use and we dont care how the sql will be managed we juts use that methods and method aare like create , find one , find and many more 

                         the entity we created in that we use one to one, one to mahy are also part of orm
entity         =====         while creatig entity we ahve make  anamimg convention singular like user not users post not posts
                        enitty is the file that contain the column of the database

Extends keyword    =====     Suppose we have dto in that we have multiple property and we want to create a new dto but it also contain the same value that the other dto conatin but in this we want them to be optional
                        so for that we can use extends it extend the property from the fisrt dto and mak ethem all optional      



Uni-directional and bi-directional relationship   ======   so basically when we are cretinga realtionshaip between 2 table so when only one table  know about the relationship so it it is unidirectional and when both table know that it is called bidirectional               


eager ===== suppose we are getting post data and we want but we are not getting metaoptiosn but we want meta option also so we can creae relation but te other option is eager is equal to treu we can add thsi in our enityt sp we dont need to create relation now when we get post we alos get metaoptions


onDelete:cascade  =========  this thing is only work on foreign key and forein key meand where we add @Join column in bidirectional relationship so basiaccly suppose we ahve post and metaoptions adn e set froeing key in post eneuty so when i delete metaoptin the post also get deleted but when i set foreign key in metaoptiosn so when i deleet post the metoptiosnmalod got dleetd it depend where we have to put foeign key 


nest js/common packages is used for http exception hanling


to preform trsnaction in nest js we use query runner
steps to crate transaction is first we ahve to crete query runner instanec
 then connnect it to the datasource
 start trsnactionif successful then commit of not than rollback
